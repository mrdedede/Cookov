## General Info
I did it as a training for both my Vue and Statistics skills, in this case especially Markov Chains.
This project is, unfortunatelly, undocummented so far and I don't think I'll be doing it anytime soon.
I hope you find some interesting use to it.

## Technologies
This project has been created with:
* Python 3.8.0
* Vue CLI 4.2.3
* Vue 2.6.11

## How can I try it?
There are two major ways of trying to use this project:

### Installing it and running it locally
First, you should have NPM and Python installed in your machine.
Then, install it locally:
```
cd /client
npm install
npm run serve
```
on another terminal/cmd, you'll just need to run:
```
cd /server
pip install Flask Flask-Cors
python server.py
```

### Using the version I host
It will be available very soon.
